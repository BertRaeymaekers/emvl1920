PointsTot   nr of point scored
Points      nr break point scored (i.e. on own team serve)
L_VP        win-lost difference
ServerTot   nr of serves
ServeErr    nr of fault serves

# Hypothesis 1: L_VP = PointsTot - ServeErr - RecErr - SpikeErr - SpikeHP
# Hypothesis 2: PointsTot = ServeAce + SpikeWin + BlockWin
